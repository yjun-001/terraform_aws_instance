# terraform_aws_instance

### create HPC aws instance by using [terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs)

### Usage:
- **terraform init**
- **terraform plan**
- **terraform apply**
```bash
>terraform apply
aws_security_group.allow_ssh_sg: Refreshing state... [id=sg-02cfa9700f8bd8c9a]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions
are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
