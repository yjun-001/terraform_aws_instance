# terraform_aws_instance

### create HPC aws instance by using [terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs)

### Usage:
terraform init
terraform plan

terraform apply
```bash
~/projs/terraform/aws$ terraform apply

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions
are indicated with the following symbols:
